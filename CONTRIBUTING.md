## How to contribute to Magnify Your Voice

1. **Found an issue you want to fix?**

    Please log a JIRA issue and assign it to yourself. This lets us keep track of ongoing work.
2. **Create a branch from `development`.**

    Title the branch `JIRAISSUEKEY-short-description`. For example, the issue https://magnify.atlassian.net/browse/MAG-204 should use the branch name `MAG-204-typescript-function-types`.
    
3. **Make your changes and test them.**
4. **When your changes are complete and working, open a PR against `development`. Use the PR template provided.**
5. **When your PR is approved, your changes will go live within a few hours on [the staging website](staging.magnifyyourvoice.com).**

   Please verify your changes are working as expected. If they are, mark your JIRA issue as `Closed`.
   
6. **Your changes will hit production the next time we do a staging -> production merge.**
